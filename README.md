## Purpose

This learning project explores key Redux concepts such as Reducers, Actions, and the Store structure.

**Store:**  
A centralized data object in the application that holds the entire state of the application. It serves as a single source of truth and makes the state accessible to all components within the application.

**Reducers:**  
Functions responsible for updating the store. They specify how the application's state should change in response to different actions dispatched within the application. Each reducer takes the current state and an action as input and returns a new state based on the action type.

**Actions:**  
Payloads of information that send data from the application to the store. These JavaScript objects contain a type field that specifies the type of action being performed. Action creators generate these action objects, which in turn trigger state changes in the store.

## Features

- Character Management: Add characters to your Bestie Squad and remove them as needed.
- Redux Integration: Experience Redux in action with reducers, actions, and the Redux store.
- Dynamic UI: The user interface updates in real-time as Besties are added or removed from the Squad.
